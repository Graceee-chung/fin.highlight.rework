MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


     
 This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, and the Notes and Schedules related thereto, which are included in this Annual Report. 
 
 Company Overview 
 
 Nuverra is a leading provider of water logistics and oilfield services to customers focused on the development and ongoing production of oil and natural gas from shale formations in the United States. Our services include the delivery, collection, and disposal of solid and liquid materials that are used in and generated by the drilling, completion, and ongoing production of shale oil and natural gas. 
 We operate in shale basins where customer exploration and production E P activities are predominantly focused on shale oil and natural gas as follows: 
 
 Oil shale areas : includes our operations in the Bakken shale area. (Our exit of the Eagle Ford shale area started March 1, 2018, and was complete by June 30, 2018. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further information on our exit of the Eagle Ford shale area.) 
 
 Natural gas shale areas : includes our operations in the Marcellus, Utica, and Haynesville shale areas. 
 We support our customers demand for diverse, comprehensive and regulatory compliant environmental solutions required for the safe and efficient drilling, completion and production of oil and natural gas from shale formations. 
 
 Our service offering focuses on providing comprehensive environmental and logistics management solutions within three primary groups: 

Water Transfer Services: Collection and transportation of flowback and produced water from drilling and completion activities to disposal network via trucking or a fixed pipeline system, and delivery of freshwater for drilling and completion activities via trucking, lay flat temporary line or fixed pipeline system. 

Disposal Services: Disposal of liquid waste water from hydraulic fracturing operations, liquid waste water from well production, and solid drilling waste in our disposal wells and landfill. 

Logistics and Wellsite Services: Rental of wellsite equipment and provision of other wellsite services including preparation and remediation. 
 We utilize a broad array of assets to meet our customers logistics and environmental management needs. Our logistics assets include trucks and trailers, temporary and permanent pipelines, temporary and permanent storage facilities, ancillary rental equipment, and liquid and solid waste disposal sites. We continue to expand our suite of solutions to customers who demand safety, environmental compliance and accountability from their service providers. 
 
 On October 5, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Clearwater Three, LLC, Clearwater Five, LLC, and Clearwater Solutions, LLC (collectively, Clearwater for an initial purchase price of 42.3 million, subject to customary working capital adjustments (the Acquisition ). Clearwater is a supplier of waste water disposal services used by the oil and gas industry in the Marcellus and Utica shale areas. Clearwater has three salt water disposal wells in service, all of which are located in Ohio. This acquisition expands our service offerings in the Marcellus and Utica shale areas in our Northeast division. Refer to Note 7 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 
 In order to address our liquidity issues due to the prolonged depression in oil and natural gas prices, on May 1, 2017, the Company and certain of its material subsidiaries (collectively with the Company, the Nuverra Parties filed voluntary petitions under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the Bankruptcy Court to pursue prepackaged plans of reorganization (together, and as amended, the Plan ). On July 25, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the Confirmation Order confirming the Plan. The Plan became effective on August 7, 2017 (the Effective Date ), when all remaining conditions to the effectiveness of the Plan were satisfied or waived. On June 22, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court issued a final decree and order closing the chapter 11 cases subject to certain conditions as set forth therein. 

31 

Upon emergence, we elected to apply fresh start accounting effective July 31, 2017, to coincide with the timing of our normal accounting period close. Refer to Note 5 on Fresh Start Accounting in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the selection of this date. As a result of the application of fresh start accounting, as well as the effects of the implementation of the Plan, a new entity for financial reporting purposes was created, and as such, the condensed consolidated financial statements on or after August 1, 2017, are not comparable with the condensed consolidated financial statements prior to that date. 
 
 References to Successor or Successor Company refer to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to July 31, 2017. References to Predecessor or Predecessor Company refer to the financial position and results of operations of the Company on and prior to July 31, 2017. 
 
 Trends Affecting Our Operating Results 
 Our results are driven by demand for our services, which are in turn affected by E P spending trends in the shale basins in which we operate, in particular the level of drilling and completion activities (which impacts the amount of water and waste products being managed) and active wells (which impacts the amount of produced water being managed). In general, drilling and completion activities in the oil and natural gas industry are affected by the market prices (or anticipated prices) for those commodities. 
 
 We saw improvement in West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices in 2018, with average oil prices of 65.23 as compared to 50.80 in 2017, while the average Henry Hub natural gas price in 2018 increased to 3.15 from 2.99 in 2017. According to Baker Hughes, average rig count in our active basins increased 15.9 year over year to 181 in 2018, and completed wells in those basins increased 28.8 year over year to 3,496 from 2,714 in 2017. (Average rig count and completed wells in our active basins no longer includes those in the Eagle Ford shale area as we have exited that basin as of June 30, 2018.) Per the US Energy Information Association, both oil production and natural gas production in the basins in which we operate were up during 2018 as compared to the prior year, with an 18.4 increase in oil production and a 21.8 increase in natural gas production. As a result of the increases in oil prices, average rig count, completed wells and overall production, we saw an increase in drilling and completion activities primarily in the Rocky Mountain and Northeast divisions in 2018 as compared with 2017. However, there is no guarantee that oil and natural gas prices will remain stable or increase, drilling and completion activities in basins will continue to increase, or we will see a continuing increase in a demand for our services. Oil and natural gas prices remain volatile, with oil prices dropping more than 40 during the fourth quarter of 2018. Another prolonged downturn in oil and natural gas prices could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in the future. 
 Our results are also driven by a number of other factors, including (i) availability of our equipment, which we have built through acquisitions and capital expenditures, (ii) transportation costs, which are affected by fuel costs, (iii) utilization rates for our equipment, which are also affected by the level of our customers drilling and production activities and competition, and our ability to relocate our equipment to areas in which oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are growing, (iv) the availability of qualified drivers (or alternatively, subcontractors) in the areas in which we operate, particularly in the Bakken, Haynesville, Marcellus, and Utica shale basins, (v) labor costs, (vi) changes in governmental laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels, (vii) seasonality and weather events (viii) pricing and (ix) our health, safety and environmental performance record.

Service Revenue 
 Service revenue consists of fees charged to customers for the removal and disposal of flowback and produced water originating from oil and natural gas wells or the transportation of fresh water and saltwater to customer sites for use in drilling and completion activities by truck or through temporary or permanent water transport pipelines. Service revenue also includes fees charged for disposal of oilfield wastes in our landfill and disposal of fluids in our disposal wells. Service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 181.8 million , up 22.8 million , or 14.4 , from 159.0 million for the year ended 
 
 33 

December 31, 2017 . Service revenue growth was driven primarily by increased customer demand for our disposal services in all divisions as average operating drilling rigs increased 16 over the prior year in the basins we serve. Additionally, we saw improvements in activity levels for water transfer services in the Rocky Mountain and Northeast divisions, offset by a decrease in activity levels for water transfer services, including our permanent disposal water pipeline, in the Southern division. Pricing increases in all divisions also contributed to the increase in service revenue during the current year. Due to management s decision to exit the Eagle Ford shale area as of March 1, 2018, only 1.8 million in revenues associated with the Eagle Ford shale area were included in service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, while 8.8 million was included in service revenue during the prior year. 
 Rental Revenue 
 Rental revenue consists of fees charged to customers over the term of the rental for use of equipment owned by us, as well as other fees charged to customers for items such as delivery and pickup. Rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 15.7 million , down 1.4 million , or 8.4 , from 17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 . However, the prior year included 1.7 million of rental revenues from the Eagle Ford shale area, while the year ended December 31, 2018 only included 0.3 million of rental revenues due to management s decision to exit the Eagle Ford shale area as of March 1, 2018. 
 Direct Operating Expenses 
 Direct operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were 158.9 million , compared to 148.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 , an increase of 7.3 . The increase in direct operating expenses is primarily a result of higher revenues resulting from increased demand for our services. Direct operating expenses improved to 80.5 of revenues from 84.1 in 2017 as a result of fixed cost leverage and pricing increases, which was partially offset by the increased usage of higher cost third party drivers to satisfy increased customer demand, particularly in the Rocky Mountain division. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were 38.5 million , up 5.3 million from 33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 . The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to higher compensation costs, including 15.3 million related to the departure of our former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, offset by decreases in legal and professional fees. Additionally, general and administrative expenses in 2018 included 1.3 million in transaction fees for the acquisition of Clearwater. General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 included 8.8 million in legal and professional fees for our chapter 11 filing that were incurred prior to the May 1, 2017 filing date. The legal and professional fees for our chapter 11 filing incurred after the May 1, 2017 filing date have been included in Reorganization items, net for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 46.4 million , down 21.1 million from 67.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 . The decrease is primarily the result of higher depreciation recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of a higher depreciable asset base with shorter useful lives due to the new fair values applied by fresh start accounting upon emergence from chapter 11. This primarily impacted depreciation expense for the first six months after the application of fresh start accounting as of July 31, 2017. 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2018, management approved plans to sell certain assets located in the Southern division as a result of exiting the Eagle Ford shale area. In addition, management approved the sale of certain assets, primarily frac tanks, located in the Northeast division, that were also expected to sell within one year. These assets qualified to be classified as assets held for sale and as the fair value of the assets was lower than the net book value, we recorded an impairment charge of 4.8 million , of which 4.4 million related to the Southern division for the Eagle Ford exit, 0.3 million related to the Corporate division for the sale of certain real property in Texas approved to be sold as part of the Eagle Ford exit, and 0.1 million related to the Northeast division. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2017, management approved plans to sell certain assets located in both the Rocky Mountain and Southern divisions, including trucks and tanks. These assets qualified to be classified as assets held for sale and as a result the assets were recorded at the lower of net book value or fair value less costs to sell. This resulted in a long-lived asset impairment charge of 4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
 See also Note 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further discussion.

Other, net 
 On March 1, 2018, the Board of Directors (the Board determined it was in the best interest of the Company to cease our operations in the Eagle Ford shale area. In making this determination, the Board considered a number of factors, including among other things, the historical and projected financial performance of our operations in the Eagle Ford shale area, pricing for our services, capital requirements and projected returns on additional capital investment, competition, scope and scale of our business operations, and recommendations from management. We substantially exited the Eagle Ford shale area as of June 30, 2018. The total costs related to the exit recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 were 1.1 million . 
 Interest Expense, net 
 Interest expense, net during the year ended December 31, 2018 was 6.0 million compared to 25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 . The decrease is primarily due to the reduction in our outstanding debt balance during 2017 as a result of the consummation of the Plan. Our average debt balance during the year ended December 31, 2018 was 52.5 million, compared to an average debt balance of 255.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. 
 Other Income, net 
 Other income, net was 0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 . The decrease is primarily attributable to a 0.4 million gain associated with the change in the fair value of the derivative warrant liability during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a 4.3 million gain during the year ended December 31, 2017. We issued warrants with derivative features upon our emergence from chapter 11 during 2017, and in connection with our debt restructuring during 2016. These instruments are accounted for as derivative liabilities with any decrease or increase in the estimated fair value recorded in Other income, net. See Note 14 and Note 15 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the warrants. 
 Reorganization Items, net 
 Expenses, gains and losses directly associated with the chapter 11 proceedings are reported as Reorganization items, net in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, which includes the net gain on debt discharge, professional and insurance fees, debtor in possession credit agreement financing costs, retention payments, and other chapter 11 related items. Included in Reorganization items, net for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 1.3 million in chapter 11 fees paid to the US Trustee. See Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further details. 
 Income Taxes 
 The income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 0.2 million (a (0.4 effective rate) compared to a benefit of 0.7 million (a (0.6 effective rate) in the prior year. The effective tax rate in 2018 is primarily the result of the change in the deferred tax liability attributable to long-lived assets. See Note 19 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information on income taxes.

 Rocky Mountain 
 
 Revenues for the Rocky Mountain division increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 due primarily to increased activity for water transfer and disposal services. Specifically, water transfer service volumes have increased due to increasing the driver force by 7 to service more active operating rigs in the Rocky Mountain division during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the prior year. Revenue improvement also came from the purchase and deployment of additional temporary water transport pipelines in early 2018. Further, volumes at the landfill and the disposal wells also increased over the prior year. For the Rocky Mountain division, direct operating costs improved as a percentage of revenue from 84.5 in 2017 to 79.7 in 2018 as a result of fixed cost leverage and pricing increases. 
 
 Northeast 
 
 Revenues for the Northeast division increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 due to a 19 increase in truck drivers to service higher activity levels for water transfer and disposal services. Additionally, the acquisition of Clearwater in the fourth quarter of 2018 and pricing increases for disposal services also contributed to the increase in revenues. For the Northeast division, direct operating costs improved to 86.4 as a percentage of revenues in 2018 as compared to 94.7 in 2017 due to fixed cost leverage and pricing increases. 
 
 Southern 
 
 Revenues for the Southern division decreased during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 due primarily to management s decision to exit the Eagle Ford shale area as of March 1, 2018. As a result, only 2.1 million in revenues associated with the Eagle Ford shale area were included for the year ended December 31, 2018 , while 10.5 million was included during the prior year. Additionally, activity levels for water transfer services, including our permanent disposal water pipeline, were down in the Southern division during the year ended December 31, 2018 . In the Southern division, direct operating costs decreased during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to the exit of the Eagle Ford shale area and lower activity levels on our permanent disposal water pipeline. 
 
 Corporate/Other 
 
 The costs associated with the Corporate/Other division are primarily general and administrative costs. The Corporate general and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 were higher than those reported for the year ended December 31, 2017 due primarily to higher compensation costs related to the departure of our former Chief Executive Officer in the first quarter of 2018 and our former Chief Financial Officer in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Service Revenue 
 Service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 159.0 million, up 19.1 million, or 13.6 , from 139.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Increases in drilling and completion activities in all divisions during 2017 led to higher service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary driver of the increase in demand in the basins we operate was a 72 increase in average operating drilling rigs from those operating in the prior year. 
 Rental Revenue 
 Rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 17.1 million, up 4.8 million, or 39.2 , from 12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was the result of higher utilization of our rental fleet in all divisions in conjunction with the increase in drilling and completion activities in 2017 due to higher oil prices. 
 Direct Operating Expenses 
 Direct operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were 148.1 million, compared to 129.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 14.2 . The increase in direct operating expenses is attributable to higher revenues as a result of increased activities in all divisions. Additionally, direct operating expenses during the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, included a loss on the sale of assets of 5.7 million and 3.5 million, respectively. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were 33.2 million, down 3.8 million from 37.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to 
 
 37 

lower legal and professional fees as the costs relating to the chapter 11 filing are included in Reorganization items, net on the consolidated statement of operations, while the costs incurred with the restructuring of our indebtedness in 2016 were included in general and administrative expenses. Offsetting the lower legal and professional fees were increased payroll costs. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 67.5 million, up 6.8 million from 60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in our depreciable base as a result of fresh start accounting after emerging from chapter 11. The overall value of property, plant and equipment increased as a result of the valuations completed in coordination with fresh start accounting. Additionally, the assets were assigned shorter useful lives during the valuation process, thus increasing depreciation expense. 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 During the year ended December 31, 2017, management approved plans to sell certain assets located in both the Rocky Mountain and Southern divisions, including trucks and tanks. These assets qualified to be classified as assets held for sale and as a result the assets were recorded at the lower of net book value or fair value less costs to sell. This resulted in a long-lived asset impairment charge of 4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2016, management approved plans to sell certain assets located in both the Northeast and Southern divisions, which resulted in a long-lived asset impairment charge of 4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2016, there were indicators that the assets in the Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Marcellus/Utica basins were not recoverable and as a result we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of 37.4 million. 
 See also Note 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further discussion. 
 Interest Expense, net 
 Interest expense, net during the year ended December 31, 2017 was 25.0 million compared to 54.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is primarily due to the reduction in our outstanding debt balance during 2017 as a result of the consummation of the Plan. As of December 31, 2017, our outstanding debt balance was 39.0 million, while as of December 31, 2016, outstanding debt was 487.6 million. The significant decrease in debt has dramatically lowered our annual interest expense. See Note 13 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further details. 
 Other Income, net 
 Other income, net was 4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is primarily attributable to the gain on the sale of Underground Solutions Inc. (or UGSI of 1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 (see Note 23 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded gains of 4.3 million and 3.3 million, respectively, associated with the change in fair value of the derivative warrant liability. We issued warrants with derivative features upon our emergence from chapter 11 during the year ended December 31, 2017, and in connection with our debt restructuring during the year ended December 31, 2016. These instruments are accounted for as derivative liabilities with any decrease or increase in the estimated fair value recorded in Other income, net. See Note 14 and Note 15 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the warrants. 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 
 During the year ended December 31, 2016, we executed two amendments to our Predecessor asset-based lending facility and as a result wrote-off 0.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the Predecessor asset-based lending facility. 
 Reorganization Items, net 
 Expenses, gains and losses directly associated with the chapter 11 proceedings are reported as Reorganization items, net in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017, which includes the net gain on debt discharge, professional and insurance fees, debtor in possession credit agreement financing costs, retention bonus payments, and other chapter 11 related items. See Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further details.

Income Taxes 
 The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 0.7 million (a (0.6 effective rate) compared to expense of 0.8 million (a (0.5 effective rate) in the prior year. The effective tax rate in 2017 is primarily the result of federal alternative minimum tax and the change in valuation allowance attributable to long-lived assets. See Note 19 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information on income taxes. 
 Loss from Discontinued Operations 
 
 Loss from discontinued operations in the years ended December 31, 2016 represents the final closing adjustments of TFI, our industrial solutions business, which was sold in April of 2015. Such loss, which is presented net of income taxes, was 1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. See Note 25 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information.

 As discussed above, we agreed, pursuant to the Bridge Term Loan Credit Agreement, to use our reasonable best efforts to effectuate and close a rights offering as soon as reasonably practicable following October 5, 2018, whereby we would dividend to our holders of common stock subscription rights to purchase shares of our common stock on a pro rata basis with an aggregate offering price of 32.5 million (the Rights Offering ). Holders who subscribed for all of their basic subscription rights also could elect to subscribe for additional shares pursuant to an over-subscription privilege. 
 
 In connection with the Rights Offering, we entered into a Backstop Commitment Letter on October 5, 2018 (the Backstop Commitment Letter with certain backstop parties named therein (the Backstop Parties ), pursuant to which the Backstop Parties agreed, subject to the terms and conditions in the Backstop Commitment Letter, to participate in the Rights Offering and agreed to acquire all unsubscribed shares remaining after stockholders exercised their over-subscription privilege. The Backstop Parties are our two largest shareholders that, in the aggregate, hold approximately 90 of our stock. In exchange for the commitments under the Backstop Commitment Letter, we paid to the Backstop Parties, in the aggregate, a nonrefundable cash payment equal to 1.0 of the full amount of the Rights Offering. 
 
 Pursuant to the Backstop Commitment Letter, we were required to file a registration statement with the SEC within 20 days following October 5, 2018. This initial Registration Statement on Form S-1 was filed with the SEC on October 25, 2018, with amendments to the Form S-1 filed on December 4, 2018 and December 7, 2018. The Registration Statement on Form S-1 respecting the Rights Offering was declared effective by the SEC on Friday, December 7, 2018. The Rights Offering launched at the close of business on December 10, 2018 and terminated, as to unexercised rights, at 5:00 p.m. New York City time on December 28, 2018. 
 
 We sold an aggregate of 3,381,894 shares of common stock at a purchase price of 9.61 per share in the Rights Offering. On January 2, 2019, we received the aggregate gross proceeds from the Rights Offering of 32.5 million and repaid in full the obligations under the Bridge Term Loan Credit Agreement. The shares of common stock subscribed for in the Rights Offering were distributed to applicable offering participants through our transfer agent or through the clearing systems of the Depository Trust Company, which commenced on January 2, 2019. Immediately after the issuance of the 3,381,894 shares for the Rights Offering which commenced on January 2, 2019, the Company had 15,614,981 common shares outstanding.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates. 
 We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and changes in these judgments and estimates may impact future results of operations and financial condition. For additional discussion of our accounting policies see Note 3 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
 Accounts receivable are recognized and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectibility of trade receivables for both billed and unbilled receivables on our service and rental revenues. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of prospective and existing customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness, as determined by a review of their current credit information. In addition, we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified. Inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates including, among others, the customer s willingness or ability to pay, our compliance with customer invoicing requirements, the effect of general economic conditions and the ongoing relationship with the customer. Additionally, if the financial condition of 
 
 45 

a specific customer or our general customer base were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Accounts receivable are presented net of allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately 1.6 million , 1.9 million , and 1.7 million at December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 respectively. 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets with Finite Useful Lives 
 We review long-lived assets including intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a long-lived asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. If an impairment indicator is present, we evaluate recoverability by comparing the estimated future cash flows of the asset group, on an undiscounted basis, to their carrying values. The asset group represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is present. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, the impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long-lived asset (or asset group). Our determination that an event or change in circumstance has occurred potentially indicating the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable generally includes but is not limited to one or more of the following: (1) a deterioration in an asset s financial performance compared to historical results, (2) a shortfall in an asset s financial performance compared to forecasted results, (3) changes affecting the utility and estimated future demands for the asset, (4) a significant decrease in the market price of an asset, (5) a current expectation that a long-lived asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life, (6) a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset (asset group) is being used or in its physical condition, and (7) declining operations and severe changes in projected cash flows. 
 We recorded total impairment charges of 4.8 million for long-lived assets classified as held for sale during the year ended December 31, 2018 , which was included in Impairment of long-lived assets in the consolidated statement of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2017 , we recorded total impairment charges for long-lived assets of 4.9 million for long-lived assets classified as held for sale. During the year ended December 31, 2016 , we recorded total impairment charges for long-lived assets of 42.2 million. These charges were due to the carrying value of assets for certain basins not being recoverable, as well as for assets that were classified as held for sale during 2016. We could recognize future impairments to the extent adverse events or changes in circumstances result in conditions in which long-lived assets are not recoverable. See Note 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our impairment charges. 
 Income Taxes and Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets 
 We are subject to federal income taxes and state income taxes in those jurisdictions in which we operate. We exercise judgment with regard to income taxes in interpreting whether expenses are deductible in accordance with federal income tax and state income tax codes, estimating annual effective federal and state income tax rates and assessing whether deferred tax assets are, more likely than not, expected to be realized. The accuracy of these judgments impacts the amount of income tax expense we recognize each period. 
 With regard to the valuation of deferred tax assets, we record valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount considered more likely than not to be realized. All available evidence is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is needed. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further information regarding the valuation of our deferred tax assets and the impact of new legislation. 
 Future realization of the tax benefit of an existing deductible temporary difference or carryforward ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the tax law. We have had significant pretax losses in recent years. Accordingly, we do not have income in carryback years. These cumulative losses also present significant negative evidence about the likelihood of income in carryforward periods. 
 Future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences are another source of taxable income that is used in this analysis. As a result, deferred tax liabilities in excess of deferred tax assets generally will provide support for recognition of deferred tax assets. However, most of our deferred tax assets are associated with net operating loss NOL carryforwards, many of which statutorily expire after a specified number of years; therefore, we compare the estimated timing of these taxable timing difference reversals with the scheduled expiration of our NOL carryforwards, considering any limitations on use of NOL carryforwards, and record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for which realization is not more likely than not. In addition, as a result of limitations on the use of our NOLs due to prior ownership changes, we have reduced our deferred tax asset and corresponding valuation allowance by the NOLs that will likely expire unused. 
 As a matter of law, we are subject to examination by federal and state taxing authorities. We have estimated and provided for income taxes in accordance with settlements reached with the Internal Revenue Service in prior audits. Although we believe that the amounts reflected in our tax returns substantially comply with the applicable federal and state tax regulations, both the 
 
 46 

IRS and the various state taxing authorities can take positions contrary to our position based on their interpretation of the law. A tax position that is challenged by a taxing authority could result in an adjustment to our income tax liabilities and related tax provision. 
 We measure and record tax contingency accruals in accordance with GAAP which prescribes a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a return. Only positions meeting the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized. A tax position is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 On January 1, 2018, we adopted the guidance in ASC 606, including all related amendments, and applied the new revenue standard to all contracts using the modified retrospective method. The impact of the new revenue standard was not material and there was no adjustment required to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under ASC 605, or the accounting guidance in effect for those periods. 
 
 Revenues are generated upon the performance of contracted services under formal and informal contracts with customers. Revenues are recognized when the contracted services for our customers are completed in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Sales and usage-based taxes are excluded from revenues. Payment is due when the contracted services are completed in accordance with the payment terms established with each customer prior to providing any services. As such, there is no significant financing component for any of our revenues. 
 
 Some of our contracts with customers involve multiple performance obligations as we are providing more than one service under the same contract, such as water transfer services and disposal services. However, our core service offerings are capable of being distinct and also are distinct within the context of contracts with our customers. As such, these services represent separate performance obligations when included in a single contract. We have standalone pricing for all of our services which is negotiated with each of our customers in advance of providing the service. The contract consideration is allocated to the individual performance obligations based upon the standalone selling price of each service, and no discount is offered for a bundled services offering. 
 Environmental and Legal Contingencies 
 We have established liabilities for environmental and legal contingencies. We record a loss contingency for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining the liability, we consider a number of factors including, but not limited to, the jurisdiction of the claim, related claims, insurance coverage when insurance covers the type of claim and our historic outcomes in similar matters, if applicable. A significant amount of judgment and the use of estimates are required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters. The determination of liabilities for these contingencies is reviewed periodically to ensure that we have accrued the proper level of expense. The liability balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues, including the effect of any applicable insurance coverage for these matters. While we believe that the amount accrued is adequate, future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations. 
 We record obligations to retire tangible, long-lived assets on our balance sheet as liabilities, which are recorded at a discount when we incur the liability. A certain amount of judgment is involved in estimating the future cash flows of such obligations, as well as the timing of these cash flows. If our assumptions and estimates on the amount or timing of the future cash flows change, it could potentially have a negative impact on our earnings.
