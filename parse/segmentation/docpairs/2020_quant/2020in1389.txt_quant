QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK


     
 
 Inflation 
 
 Inflationary factors, such as increases in our cost structure, could impair our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs.

Commodity Risk 
 
 We are subject to market risk exposures arising from declines in oil and natural gas drilling activity in unconventional areas, which is primarily a function of the market price for oil and natural gas. Various factors beyond our control affect the market prices for oil and natural gas, including but not limited to the level of consumer demand, governmental regulation, the price and availability of alternative fuels, political instability in foreign markets, weather-related factors and the overall economic environment. Market prices for oil and natural gas historically have been volatile and unpredictable, and we expect this volatility to continue in the future. Prolonged declines in the market price of oil and/or natural gas could contribute to declines in drilling activity and accordingly would reduce demand for our services. We attempt to manage this risk by strategically aligning our assets with those areas where we believe demand is highest and market conditions for our services are most favorable. If there is further deterioration in our business operations or prospects, our stock price, the broader economy or our industry, including further declines in oil and natural gas prices, the value of our long-lived assets, or those we may acquire in the future, could decrease significantly and result in additional impairment and financial statement write-offs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Interest Rates 
 As of December 31, 2019 , no borrowings were outstanding under the Successor Revolving Facility, while the outstanding principal balance on the Successor First Lien Term Loan was 18.0 million . Interest on the Successor Revolving Facility accrues at an annual rate equal to the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus 5.25 , and interest on the Successor First Lien Term Loan accrues at an annual rate equal to the LIBOR Rate plus 7.25 . The weighted average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 7.5 for the Successor Revolving Facility and 9.5 for the Successor First Lien Term Loan. We have assessed our exposure to changes in interest rates on variable rate debt by analyzing the sensitivity to our earnings assuming various changes in market interest rates. Assuming a hypothetical increase of 1 to the interest rates on the average outstanding balance of our variable rate debt portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2019 , our net interest expense for year ended December 31, 2019 would have increased by an estimated 0.5 million.
