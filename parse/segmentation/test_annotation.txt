1403853_19_P8_S2	The Plan became effective on August 7, 2017 (the Effective Date ), when all remaining conditions to the effectiveness of the Plan were satisfied or waived.
1403853_19_P8_S3	On June 22, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court issued a final decree and order closing the chapter 11 cases subject to certain conditions as set forth therein.
1403853_19_P9_S0	Upon emergence, we elected to apply fresh start accounting effective July 31, 2017, to coincide with the timing of our normal accounting period close.
1403853_19_P9_S1	Refer to Note 5 on Fresh Start Accounting in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the selection of this date.
1403853_19_P9_S2	As a result of the [application of fresh start accounting], as well as the effects of the implementation of the Plan, a new entity for financial reporting purposes was created, and as such, the [condensed consolidated financial statements on or after August 1, 2017, are not comparable with the condensed consolidated financial statements prior to that date].
1403853_19_P10_S0	[References to Successor or Successor Company] refer to the financial position and results of operations of the [reorganized Company subsequent to July 31, 2017.]
1403853_19_P10_S1	[References to Predecessor or Predecessor Company] refer to the financial position and results of operations of the [Company on and prior to July 31, 2017.]
1403853_19_P11_S0	Trends Affecting Our Operating Results Our results are driven by demand for our services, which are in turn affected by [E P spending trends in the shale basins] in which we operate, in particular the level of drilling and completion activities (which impacts the amount of water and waste products being managed) and active wells (which impacts the amount of produced water being managed).
1403853_19_P11_S1	In general, drilling and completion activities in the oil and natural gas industry are affected by the market prices (or anticipated prices) for those commodities.
1403853_19_P12_S0	We saw [improvement in West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices in 2018], with [average oil prices of 65.23 as compared to 50.80 in 2017], while the [average Henry Hub natural gas price in 2018 increased to 3.15 from 2.99 in 2017].
1403853_19_P12_S1	According to Baker Hughes, [average rig count] in our active basins [increased 15.9 year over year to 181 in 2018], and [completed wells] in those basins [increased 28.8 year over year to 3,496 from 2,714 in 2017].
1403853_19_P12_S2	Per the US Energy Information Association, both [oil production and natural gas production] in the basins in which [we operate were up] during 2018 as compared to the prior year, with an [18.4 increase in oil production] and a [21.8 increase in natural gas production].
1403853_19_P12_S3	As a result of the increases in oil prices, average rig count, completed wells and overall production, we saw an [increase in] drilling and completion [activities primarily in the Rocky Mountain and Northeast divisions] in 2018 as compared with 2017.
1403853_19_P12_S4	However, there is no guarantee that oil and natural gas prices will remain stable or increase, drilling and completion activities in basins will continue to increase, or we will see a continuing increase in a demand for our services.
1403853_19_P12_S5	Oil and natural gas prices remain volatile, with oil prices dropping more than 40 during the fourth quarter of 2018.
1403853_19_P12_S6	Another prolonged downturn in oil and natural gas prices could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in the future.
1403853_19_P12_S7	Our results are also driven by a number of other factors, including (i) availability of our equipment, which we have built through acquisitions and capital expenditures, (ii) transportation costs, which are affected by fuel costs, (iii) utilization rates for our equipment, which are also affected by the level of our customers drilling and production activities and competition, and our ability to relocate our equipment to areas in which oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are growing, (iv) the availability of qualified drivers (or alternatively, subcontractors) in the areas in which we operate, particularly in the Bakken, Haynesville, Marcellus, and Utica shale basins, (v) labor costs, (vi) changes in governmental laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels, (vii) seasonality and weather events (viii) pricing and (ix) our health, safety and environmental performance record.
1403853_19_P13_S0	(a) Represents revenues that are derived from predominantly oil-rich basins consisting of the Bakken shale area and the Eagle Ford shale area (which we substantially exited during the six months ended June 30, 2018).
1403853_19_P13_S1	(b) Represents revenues that are derived from predominantly natural gas-rich basins consisting of the Marcellus, Utica, and Haynesville shale areas.
1403853_19_P14_S0	Service Revenue Service revenue consists of fees charged to customers for the removal and disposal of flowback and produced water originating from oil and natural gas wells or the transportation of fresh water and saltwater to customer sites for use in drilling and completion activities by truck or through temporary or permanent water transport pipelines.
1403853_19_P14_S1	Service revenue also includes fees charged for disposal of oilfield wastes in our landfill and disposal of fluids in our disposal wells.
1403853_19_P15_S0	[Service revenue growth] was [driven] primarily [by] increased customer demand for our disposal services in all divisions as [average operating drilling rigs increased 16] over the prior year in the basins we serve.
1403853_19_P15_S1	Additionally, we saw [improvements in activity levels for water transfer services] in the [Rocky Mountain and Northeast divisions], [offset by] a decrease in activity levels for water transfer services, including our permanent disposal water pipeline, in the [Southern division].
1403853_19_P15_S2	Pricing increases in all divisions also contributed to the increase in service revenue during the current year.
1403853_19_P15_S3	Due to management s decision to [exit the Eagle Ford shale area] as of March 1, 2018, only [1.8 million in revenues] associated with the Eagle Ford shale area [were included in service revenues] for the year ended December 31, 2018, while 8.8 million was included in service revenue during the prior year.
1403853_19_P15_S4	Rental Revenue Rental revenue consists of fees charged to customers over the term of the rental for use of equipment owned by us, as well as other fees charged to customers for items such as delivery and pickup.
1403853_19_P15_S5	[Rental revenue] for the year ended December 31, 2018 was [15.7 million] , [down 1.4 million , or 8.4 , from 17.1 million for] the year ended December 31, [2017].
1403853_19_P15_S6	However, the prior year included 1.7 million of rental revenues from the Eagle Ford shale area, while the year ended December 31, 2018 only included 0.3 million of rental revenues due to management s decision to exit the Eagle Ford shale area as of March 1, 2018.
1403853_19_P15_S7	[Direct Operating Expenses] Direct operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were [158.9 million] , compared to 148.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 , an [increase of 7.3] .
1403853_19_P15_S8	The increase in direct operating expenses is primarily a result of higher revenues resulting from increased demand for our services.
1403853_19_P15_S9	Direct operating expenses improved to 80.5 of revenues from 84.1 in 2017 as a result of fixed cost leverage and pricing increases, which was partially offset by the increased usage of higher cost third party drivers to satisfy increased customer demand, particularly in the Rocky Mountain division.
1403853_19_P15_S10	[General and Administrative Expenses] General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were [38.5 million] , [up 5.3 million] from 33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 .
1403853_19_P15_S11	The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to higher compensation costs, including [15.3 million related to the departure of our former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer], offset by decreases in legal and professional fees.
1403853_19_P15_S12	Additionally, general and administrative expenses in 2018 [included 1.3 million in transaction fees for the acquisition of Clearwater].
1403853_19_P15_S13	General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 included 8.8 million in legal and professional fees for our chapter 11 filing that were incurred prior to the May 1, 2017 filing date.
1403853_19_P15_S14	The legal and professional fees for our chapter 11 filing incurred after the May 1, 2017 filing date have been included in Reorganization items, net for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1403853_19_P15_S15	[Depreciation and Amortization] Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2018 was [46.4 million] , [down 21.1 million] from 67.5 million [for] the year ended December 31, [2017] .
1403853_19_P15_S16	The decrease is primarily the result of higher depreciation recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 [as a result of a higher depreciable asset base with shorter useful lives due to the new fair values applied by fresh start accounting upon emergence from chapter 11].
1403853_19_P15_S17	This primarily impacted depreciation expense for the first six months after the application of fresh start accounting as of July 31, 2017.
1403853_19_P16_S0	During the year ended December 31, [2018], management approved plans to [sell] certain [assets located in the Southern division] as a result of exiting the Eagle Ford shale area.
1403853_19_P16_S1	In addition, management approved the [sale] of certain assets, primarily [frac tanks], located [in the Northeast division], that were also expected to sell within one year.
1403853_19_P16_S2	These assets qualified to be classified as assets held for sale and as the [fair value] of the assets was [lower than the net book value], we recorded an [impairment charge of 4.8 million] , of which 4.4 million related to the Southern division for the Eagle Ford exit, 0.3 million related to the Corporate division for the sale of certain real property in Texas approved to be sold as part of the Eagle Ford exit, and 0.1 million related to the Northeast division.
1403853_19_P16_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2017, management approved plans to sell certain assets located in both the Rocky Mountain and Southern divisions, including trucks and tanks.
1403853_19_P16_S4	These assets qualified to be classified as assets held for sale and as a result the assets were recorded at the lower of net book value or fair value less costs to sell.
1403853_19_P16_S5	This resulted in a long-lived asset impairment charge of 4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1403853_19_P16_S6	See also Note 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further discussion.
1403853_19_P17_S0	Other, net On March 1, 2018, the Board of Directors (the Board determined it was in the best interest of the Company to cease our operations in the Eagle Ford shale area.
1403853_19_P17_S1	In making this determination, the Board considered a number of factors, including among other things, the historical and projected financial performance of our operations in the Eagle Ford shale area, pricing for our services, capital requirements and projected returns on additional capital investment, competition, scope and scale of our business operations, and recommendations from management.
1403853_19_P17_S2	We substantially exited the Eagle Ford shale area as of June 30, 2018.
1403853_19_P17_S3	The total costs related to the exit recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 were 1.1 million .

1403853_19_P17_S5	The decrease is primarily due to the reduction in our outstanding debt balance during 2017 as a result of the consummation of the Plan.
1403853_19_P17_S6	Our average debt balance during the year ended December 31, 2018 was 52.5 million, compared to an average debt balance of 255.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.

1403853_19_P17_S8	The decrease is primarily attributable to a 0.4 million gain associated with the change in the fair value of the derivative warrant liability during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a 4.3 million gain during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1403853_19_P17_S9	We issued warrants with derivative features upon our emergence from chapter 11 during 2017, and in connection with our debt restructuring during 2016.

1403853_19_P17_S16	The effective tax rate in 2018 is primarily the result of the change in the deferred tax liability attributable to long-lived assets.
1403853_19_P17_S17	See Note 19 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information on income taxes.
1403853_19_P18_S0	(2) Represents the combined results from the five months ended December 31, 2017 (Successor) and the seven months ended July 31, 2017 (Predecessor).
1403853_19_P19_S0	Revenues for the Rocky Mountain division increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 due primarily to increased activity for water transfer and disposal services.
1403853_19_P19_S1	Specifically, water transfer service volumes have increased due to increasing the driver force by 7 to service more active operating rigs in the Rocky Mountain division during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the prior year.
1403853_19_P19_S2	Revenue improvement also came from the purchase and deployment of additional temporary water transport pipelines in early 2018.
1403853_19_P19_S3	Further, volumes at the landfill and the disposal wells also increased over the prior year.
1403853_19_P19_S4	For the Rocky Mountain division, direct operating costs improved as a percentage of revenue from 84.5 in 2017 to 79.7 in 2018 as a result of fixed cost leverage and pricing increases.
1403853_19_P20_S0	Revenues for the Northeast division increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 due to a 19 increase in truck drivers to service higher activity levels for water transfer and disposal services.
1403853_19_P20_S1	Additionally, the acquisition of Clearwater in the fourth quarter of 2018 and pricing increases for disposal services also contributed to the increase in revenues.
1403853_19_P20_S2	For the Northeast division, direct operating costs improved to 86.4 as a percentage of revenues in 2018 as compared to 94.7 in 2017 due to fixed cost leverage and pricing increases.
1403853_19_P21_S0	Revenues for the Southern division decreased during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 due primarily to management s decision to exit the Eagle Ford shale area as of March 1, 2018.
1403853_19_P21_S1	As a result, only 2.1 million in revenues associated with the Eagle Ford shale area were included for the year ended December 31, 2018 , while 10.5 million was included during the prior year.
1403853_19_P21_S2	Additionally, activity levels for water transfer services, including our permanent disposal water pipeline, were down in the Southern division during the year ended December 31, 2018 .
1403853_19_P21_S3	In the Southern division, direct operating costs decreased during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to the exit of the Eagle Ford shale area and lower activity levels on our permanent disposal water pipeline.
1403853_19_P22_S0	The costs associated with the Corporate/Other division are primarily general and administrative costs.
1403853_19_P22_S1	The Corporate general and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 were higher than those reported for the year ended December 31, 2017 due primarily to higher compensation costs related to the departure of our former Chief Executive Officer in the first quarter of 2018 and our former Chief Financial Officer in the fourth quarter of 2018.
1403853_19_P23_S0	Service Revenue Service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 159.0 million, up 19.1 million, or 13.6 , from 139.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1403853_19_P23_S1	Increases in drilling and completion activities in all divisions during 2017 led to higher service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.
1403853_19_P23_S2	The primary driver of the increase in demand in the basins we operate was a 72 increase in average operating drilling rigs from those operating in the prior year.
1403853_19_P23_S3	Rental Revenue Rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 17.1 million, up 4.8 million, or 39.2 , from 12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1403853_19_P23_S4	The increase was the result of higher utilization of our rental fleet in all divisions in conjunction with the increase in drilling and completion activities in 2017 due to higher oil prices.
1403853_19_P23_S5	Direct Operating Expenses Direct operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were 148.1 million, compared to 129.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 14.2 .

1403853_19_P24_S1	Offsetting the lower legal and professional fees were increased payroll costs.
1403853_19_P24_S2	Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 67.5 million, up 6.8 million from 60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1403853_19_P24_S3	The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in our depreciable base as a result of fresh start accounting after emerging from chapter 11.
1403853_19_P24_S4	The overall value of property, plant and equipment increased as a result of the valuations completed in coordination with fresh start accounting.
1403853_19_P24_S5	Additionally, the assets were assigned shorter useful lives during the valuation process, thus increasing depreciation expense.
1403853_19_P24_S6	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets During the year ended December 31, 2017, management approved plans to sell certain assets located in both the Rocky Mountain and Southern divisions, including trucks and tanks.
1403853_19_P24_S7	These assets qualified to be classified as assets held for sale and as a result the assets were recorded at the lower of net book value or fair value less costs to sell.
1403853_19_P24_S8	This resulted in a long-lived asset impairment charge of 4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1403853_19_P24_S9	During the year ended December 31, 2016, management approved plans to sell certain assets located in both the Northeast and Southern divisions, which resulted in a long-lived asset impairment charge of 4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1403853_19_P24_S10	Additionally, long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
1403853_19_P24_S11	During the year ended December 31, 2016, there were indicators that the assets in the Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Marcellus/Utica basins were not recoverable and as a result we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of 37.4 million.
1403853_19_P24_S12	See also Note 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further discussion.
1403853_19_P24_S13	Interest Expense, net Interest expense, net during the year ended December 31, 2017 was 25.0 million compared to 54.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1403853_19_P24_S14	The decrease is primarily due to the reduction in our outstanding debt balance during 2017 as a result of the consummation of the Plan.
1403853_19_P24_S15	As of December 31, 2017, our outstanding debt balance was 39.0 million, while as of December 31, 2016, outstanding debt was 487.6 million.

1403853_19_P51_S0	The following table details our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands).
1403853_19_P51_S1	See Note 20 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
1403853_19_P52_S0	(1) Principal payments are reflected when contractually required.
1403853_19_P52_S1	(2) Estimated interest on debt for all periods presented is calculated using interest rates available as of December 31, 2018 and includes fees for the unused portion of our Successor Revolving Facility.

1403853_19_P52_S4	See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the settlement.
1403853_19_P52_S5	(5) Represents estimated future costs related to the closure and/or remediation of our disposal wells and landfill.
1403853_19_P52_S6	As we are uncertain as to when these future costs will be paid, the majority of the obligation has been presented in the more than five years column.
1403853_19_P53_S0	Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2018 , we did not have any material off-balance-sheet arrangements other than operating leases, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.
1403853_19_P54_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ).
1403853_19_P54_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1403853_19_P54_S2	Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates.
1403853_19_P54_S3	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and changes in these judgments and estimates may impact future results of operations and financial condition.
1403853_19_P54_S4	For additional discussion of our accounting policies see Note 3 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable are recognized and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts.
1403853_19_P54_S5	We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectibility of trade receivables for both billed and unbilled receivables on our service and rental revenues.
1403853_19_P54_S6	We perform ongoing credit evaluations of prospective and existing customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness, as determined by a review of their current credit information.
1403853_19_P54_S7	In addition, we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified.
1403853_19_P54_S8	Inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates including, among others, the customer s willingness or ability to pay, our compliance with customer invoicing requirements, the effect of general economic conditions and the ongoing relationship with the customer.
1403853_19_P55_S0	a specific customer or our general customer base were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
1403853_19_P55_S1	Accounts receivable are presented net of allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately 1.6 million , 1.9 million , and 1.7 million at December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 respectively.
1403853_19_P55_S2	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets with Finite Useful Lives We review long-lived assets including intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a long-lived asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable.
1403853_19_P55_S3	If an impairment indicator is present, we evaluate recoverability by comparing the estimated future cash flows of the asset group, on an undiscounted basis, to their carrying values.
1403853_19_P55_S4	The asset group represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities.
1403853_19_P55_S5	If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is present.
1403853_19_P55_S6	If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, the impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long-lived asset (or asset group).
1403853_19_P55_S7	Our determination that an event or change in circumstance has occurred potentially indicating the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable generally includes but is not limited to one or more of the following: (1) a deterioration in an asset s financial performance compared to historical results, (2) a shortfall in an asset s financial performance compared to forecasted results, (3) changes affecting the utility and estimated future demands for the asset, (4) a significant decrease in the market price of an asset, (5) a current expectation that a long-lived asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life, (6) a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset (asset group) is being used or in its physical condition, and (7) declining operations and severe changes in projected cash flows.
1403853_19_P55_S8	We recorded total impairment charges of 4.8 million for long-lived assets classified as held for sale during the year ended December 31, 2018 , which was included in Impairment of long-lived assets in the consolidated statement of operations.
1403853_19_P55_S9	During the year ended December 31, 2017 , we recorded total impairment charges for long-lived assets of 4.9 million for long-lived assets classified as held for sale.
1403853_19_P55_S10	During the year ended December 31, 2016 , we recorded total impairment charges for long-lived assets of 42.2 million.
1403853_19_P55_S11	These charges were due to the carrying value of assets for certain basins not being recoverable, as well as for assets that were classified as held for sale during 2016.
1403853_19_P55_S12	We could recognize future impairments to the extent adverse events or changes in circumstances result in conditions in which long-lived assets are not recoverable.
1403853_19_P55_S13	See Note 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our impairment charges.
1403853_19_P55_S14	Income Taxes and Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets We are subject to federal income taxes and state income taxes in those jurisdictions in which we operate.
1403853_19_P55_S15	We exercise judgment with regard to income taxes in interpreting whether expenses are deductible in accordance with federal income tax and state income tax codes, estimating annual effective federal and state income tax rates and assessing whether deferred tax assets are, more likely than not, expected to be realized.
1403853_19_P55_S16	The accuracy of these judgments impacts the amount of income tax expense we recognize each period.
1403853_19_P55_S17	With regard to the valuation of deferred tax assets, we record valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount considered more likely than not to be realized.
1403853_19_P55_S18	All available evidence is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is needed.
1403853_19_P55_S19	See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further information regarding the valuation of our deferred tax assets and the impact of new legislation.
1403853_19_P55_S20	Future realization of the tax benefit of an existing deductible temporary difference or carryforward ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the tax law.
1403853_19_P55_S21	We have had significant pretax losses in recent years.
1403853_19_P55_S22	Accordingly, we do not have income in carryback years.
1403853_19_P55_S23	These cumulative losses also present significant negative evidence about the likelihood of income in carryforward periods.
1403853_19_P55_S24	Future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences are another source of taxable income that is used in this analysis.
1403853_19_P55_S25	As a result, deferred tax liabilities in excess of deferred tax assets generally will provide support for recognition of deferred tax assets.
1403853_19_P55_S26	However, most of our deferred tax assets are associated with net operating loss NOL carryforwards, many of which statutorily expire after a specified number of years; therefore, we compare the estimated timing of these taxable timing difference reversals with the scheduled expiration of our NOL carryforwards, considering any limitations on use of NOL carryforwards, and record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for which realization is not more likely than not.
1403853_19_P55_S27	In addition, as a result of limitations on the use of our NOLs due to prior ownership changes, we have reduced our deferred tax asset and corresponding valuation allowance by the NOLs that will likely expire unused.
1403853_19_P55_S28	As a matter of law, we are subject to examination by federal and state taxing authorities.
1403853_19_P55_S29	We have estimated and provided for income taxes in accordance with settlements reached with the Internal Revenue Service in prior audits.
1403853_19_P56_S0	IRS and the various state taxing authorities can take positions contrary to our position based on their interpretation of the law.
1403853_19_P56_S1	A tax position that is challenged by a taxing authority could result in an adjustment to our income tax liabilities and related tax provision.
1403853_19_P56_S2	We measure and record tax contingency accruals in accordance with GAAP which prescribes a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a return.
1403853_19_P56_S3	Only positions meeting the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized.
1403853_19_P56_S4	A tax position is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1403853_19_P57_S0	On January 1, 2018, we adopted the guidance in ASC 606, including all related amendments, and applied the new revenue standard to all contracts using the modified retrospective method.
1403853_19_P57_S1	The impact of the new revenue standard was not material and there was no adjustment required to the opening balance of retained earnings.
1403853_19_P57_S2	The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under ASC 605, or the accounting guidance in effect for those periods.
1403853_19_P58_S0	Revenues are generated upon the performance of contracted services under formal and informal contracts with customers.
1403853_19_P58_S1	Revenues are recognized when the contracted services for our customers are completed in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.
1403853_19_P58_S2	Sales and usage-based taxes are excluded from revenues.
1403853_19_P58_S3	Payment is due when the contracted services are completed in accordance with the payment terms established with each customer prior to providing any services.
1403853_19_P58_S4	As such, there is no significant financing component for any of our revenues.
1403853_19_P59_S0	Some of our contracts with customers involve multiple performance obligations as we are providing more than one service under the same contract, such as water transfer services and disposal services.
1403853_19_P59_S1	However, our core service offerings are capable of being distinct and also are distinct within the context of contracts with our customers.
1403853_19_P59_S2	As such, these services represent separate performance obligations when included in a single contract.
1403853_19_P59_S3	We have standalone pricing for all of our services which is negotiated with each of our customers in advance of providing the service.
1403853_19_P59_S4	The contract consideration is allocated to the individual performance obligations based upon the standalone selling price of each service, and no discount is offered for a bundled services offering.
1403853_19_P59_S5	Environmental and Legal Contingencies We have established liabilities for environmental and legal contingencies.
1403853_19_P59_S6	We record a loss contingency for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
1403853_19_P59_S7	In determining the liability, we consider a number of factors including, but not limited to, the jurisdiction of the claim, related claims, insurance coverage when insurance covers the type of claim and our historic outcomes in similar matters, if applicable.
1403853_19_P59_S8	A significant amount of judgment and the use of estimates are required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters.
1403853_19_P59_S9	The determination of liabilities for these contingencies is reviewed periodically to ensure that we have accrued the proper level of expense.
1403853_19_P59_S10	The liability balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues, including the effect of any applicable insurance coverage for these matters.
1403853_19_P59_S11	While we believe that the amount accrued is adequate, future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations.
1403853_19_P59_S12	We record obligations to retire tangible, long-lived assets on our balance sheet as liabilities, which are recorded at a discount when we incur the liability.
1403853_19_P59_S13	A certain amount of judgment is involved in estimating the future cash flows of such obligations, as well as the timing of these cash flows.
1403853_19_P59_S14	If our assumptions and estimates on the amount or timing of the future cash flows change, it could potentially have a negative impact on our earnings.
1403853_19_P60_S0	See the Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements section of Note 3 on Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for a complete description of recent accounting standards which may be applicable to our operations.
1403853_19_P60_S1	The significant accounting standards that have been adopted during the year ended December 31, 2018 are described in Note 2 on Basis of Presentation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein.

1403853_20_P3_S1	Clearwater is a supplier of waste water disposal services used by the oil and gas industry in the Marcellus and Utica shale areas.
1403853_20_P3_S2	Clearwater has three salt water disposal wells in service, all of which are located in Ohio.
1403853_20_P3_S3	This acquisition expanded our service offerings in the Marcellus and Utica shale areas in our Northeast division.
1403853_20_P3_S4	Refer to Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
1403853_20_P4_S0	On July 25, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the Confirmation Order confirming the Plan.
1403853_20_P4_S1	The Plan became effective on August 7, 2017 (the Effective Date ), when all remaining conditions to the effectiveness of the Plan were satisfied or waived.
1403853_20_P4_S2	On June 22, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court issued a final decree and order closing the chapter 11 cases subject to certain conditions as set forth therein.
1403853_20_P5_S0	Upon emergence, we elected to apply fresh start accounting effective July 31, 2017, to coincide with the timing of our normal accounting period close.
1403853_20_P5_S1	Refer to Note 26 on Fresh Start Accounting in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the selection of this date.
1403853_20_P5_S2	As a result of the application of fresh start accounting, as well as the effects of the implementation of the Plan, a new entity for financial reporting purposes was created, and as such, the condensed consolidated financial statements on or after August 1, 2017, are not comparable with the condensed consolidated financial statements prior to that date.
1403853_20_P6_S0	References to Successor or Successor Company refer to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to July 31, 2017.
1403853_20_P6_S1	References to Predecessor or Predecessor Company refer to the financial position and results of operations of the Company on and prior to July 31, 2017.
1403853_20_P7_S0	Trends Affecting Our Operating Results Our results are affected by capital expenditures made by the exploration and production operators in the shale basins in which we operate.
1403853_20_P7_S1	These capital expenditures determine the level of drilling and completion activity which determines the amount and volume of produced water, water for fracking, flowback water, drill cuttings and rental equipment requirements that determine the demand for our services.
1403853_20_P7_S2	The primary drivers of these expenditures are current or anticipated prices of crude oil and natural gas.
1403853_20_P7_S3	Crude prices as measured by the average price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate averaged 56.98 in 2019 compared to 65.23 in 2018.
1403853_20_P7_S4	Natural gas prices as measured by the Henry Hub Natural Gas index averaged 2.56 in 2019 compared to 3.15 in 2018.
1403853_20_P7_S5	Prices have continued to decline in 2020 and the same crude index was 44.76 on February 28, 2020 and natural gas prices were 1.93 on February 25, 2020.
1403853_20_P7_S6	A second important trend has been the focus of Wall Street and investors in the energy sector to encourage exploration and production operators to spend as a function of the cash flow they generate.
1403853_20_P7_S7	Historically, as a result of accommodating debt and equity markets, exploration and production companies have been able to spend in excess of the cash flow generated by the business.
1403853_20_P7_S8	This current trend has brought increased capital discipline to exploration and production companies who are careful to make more selective capital allocation decisions.
1403853_20_P7_S9	It is expected that this trend, in addition to the lower commodity prices, will force exploration and production companies to spend approximately 15 less in 2020 than they spent in 2019.
1403853_20_P7_S10	A third trend we have observed is the increase in infrastructure to handle produced water.
1403853_20_P7_S11	Many believe the economics of fixed infrastructure are more attractive than using trucks.
1403853_20_P7_S12	As a result, we have seen a number of independent water midstream businesses emerge and grow as well as a number of exploration and production operators developing their own infrastructure.
1403853_20_P7_S13	These businesses are direct competitors to our trucking operations.
1403853_20_P7_S14	This phenomenon is most noticeable in the Bakken and Haynesville regions.
1403853_20_P7_S15	We have not seen this trend in the Northeast.
1403853_20_P7_S16	We are making concerted efforts to connect our salt water disposal network to pipeline infrastructure.
1403853_20_P7_S17	We have seen the growth of lay flat hose as a means of getting freshwater to drilling sites where terrain and water sources make temporary pipeline more cost effective than trucking freshwater.
1403853_20_P7_S18	The lay flat hose is an above-ground temporary source of water that in certain locations is more economical to exploration and production operators than the trucking of fresh water to completion locations.
1403853_20_P7_S19	We have seen new entrants in the business creating significant pricing pressure.
1403853_20_P7_S20	An important part of this business is access to fresh water sources.
1403853_20_P7_S21	We do not have the same access to fresh water sources as some of our competitors and have thus been disadvantaged in many of the bids we participated in throughout 2019.
1403853_20_P7_S22	We have hired a dedicated employee to focus on improving access to fresh water sources.
1403853_20_P7_S23	Lastly, we have seen an increase in reuse and water sharing in the Northeast.
1403853_20_P7_S24	Some of our customers are using produced and flowback water for fracking as they have determined it is more economical to transport produced water to sites than it is to dispose of the water.
1403853_20_P7_S25	Operators are also sharing water with other operators to avoid disposal.
1403853_20_P7_S26	This work still requires trucking services, but is generally shorter haul work done at an hourly rate which negatively impacts our revenues.
1403853_20_P8_S0	availability of qualified employees (or alternatively, subcontractors) in the areas in which we operate, (v) labor costs, (vi) changes in governmental laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels, (vii) seasonality and weather events, (viii) pricing and (ix) our health, safety and environmental performance record.
1403853_20_P8_S1	While we have agreements in place with certain of our customers to establish pricing for our services and various other terms and conditions, these agreements typically do not contain minimum volume commitments or otherwise require the customer to use us.
1403853_20_P8_S2	Accordingly, our customer agreements generally provide the customer the ability to change the relationship by either in-sourcing some or all services we have historically provided or by contracting with other service providers.
1403853_20_P8_S3	As a result, even with respect to customers with which we have an agreement to establish pricing, the revenue we ultimately receive from that customer, and the mix of revenue among lines of services provided, is unpredictable and subject to variation over time.
1403853_20_P9_S0	Service Revenue Service revenue consists of fees charged to customers for water transfer services, disposal services and other service revenues associated with the drilling, completion, and ongoing production of shale oil and natural gas.
1403853_20_P9_S1	On a consolidated basis, service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 152.5 million , down 29.3 million , or 16.1 , from 181.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 .
1403853_20_P9_S2	The largest contributors to the decline in service revenues were Rocky Mountain third party trucking activity and lay flat hose projects, slower trucking activity in the Northeast due to customers moving to reuse of produced water and overall activity declines and, in the South, the loss of a large customer that historically consumed a material percentage of the capacity on our Haynesville pipeline.
1403853_20_P9_S3	These declines were partially offset by an increase in disposal revenues in all three divisions.
1403853_20_P9_S4	Additionally, 1.8 million in revenues associated with the Eagle Ford Shale area were included in service revenues in the prior year but did not reoccur in the current year due to management s decision to exit the Eagle Ford Shale area as of March 1, 2018.
1403853_20_P9_S5	As the primary causes of the decreases in water transfer services and increases in disposal services are different for all three divisions, see Segment Operating Results below for further discussion.
1403853_20_P10_S0	Rental Revenue Rental revenue consists of fees charged to customers for use of equipment owned by us, as well as other fees charged to customers for services, such as delivery and pickup of equipment.
1403853_20_P10_S1	Our rental business is primarily located in the Rocky Mountain division, however, we do have some rental equipment available in both the Northeast and Southern divisions.
1403853_20_P10_S2	Rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 15.7 million , up 16.0 thousand , or 0.1 , from the year ended December 31, 2018 .
1403853_20_P10_S3	The prior year period included 0.3 million of rental revenues for the Eagle Ford Shale area that did not reoccur in the current year due to management s decision to exit the Eagle Ford Shale area as of March 1, 2018.
1403853_20_P10_S4	When removing the impact of the Eagle Ford exit, rental revenues increased by 0.3 million primarily as a result of pricing increases implemented in the Rocky Mountain division.
1403853_20_P10_S5	Direct Operating Expenses Direct operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 were 131.0 million , compared to 158.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 , a decrease of 17.5 .
1403853_20_P10_S6	While the decrease in direct operating expenses is primarily attributable to lower activity levels for water transfer services during the period, direct operating expenses improved to 77.9 of revenues from 80.5 in the prior year period as a result of favorable service mix due to more higher margin work, a reduction in outsourced trucking and active cost reduction efforts during the past year.
1403853_20_P10_S7	General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 were 20.9 million , down 17.6 million from 38.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 .
1403853_20_P10_S8	The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to higher compensation costs in the prior year, including 15.3 million related to the departures of our former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
1403853_20_P10_S9	Additionally, general and administrative expenses in 2018 included 1.3 million in transaction fees for the acquisition of Clearwater.
1403853_20_P10_S10	Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 36.2 million , down 10.3 million from 46.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 .
1403853_20_P10_S11	The decrease is primarily attributable to a lower depreciable asset base due to the sale of under-utilized or non-core assets, assets becoming fully depreciated and assets being classified as held for sale with the resulting cessation of depreciation.
1403853_20_P11_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2019, management approved plans to sell real property located in the Northeast and Rocky Mountain divisions.
1403853_20_P11_S1	The real property qualified to be classified as held for sale and as a result was recorded at the lower of net book value or fair value less costs to sell, which resulted in long-lived asset impairment charges of 0.8 million , of which 0.6 million related to the Northeast division and 0.1 million related to the Rocky Mountain division.
1403853_20_P12_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2018, management approved plans to sell certain assets located in the Southern division as a result of exiting the Eagle Ford shale area.
1403853_20_P12_S1	In addition, management approved the sale of certain assets, primarily frac tanks, located in the Northeast division, that were also expected to sell within one year.
1403853_20_P12_S2	These assets qualified to be classified as assets held for sale and as the fair value of the assets was lower than the net book value, we recorded an impairment charge of 4.8 million , of which 4.4 million related to the Southern division for the Eagle Ford exit, 0.3 million related to the Corporate division for the sale of certain real property in Texas approved to be sold as part of the Eagle Ford exit, and 0.1 million related to the Northeast division.
1403853_20_P12_S3	See also Note 8 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further discussion.
1403853_20_P13_S0	When we reviewed goodwill for impairment as of October 1, 2019, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units were less than their carrying value.
1403853_20_P13_S1	As a result, we completed the goodwill impairment test and determined that the fair value of all three reporting units was less than the carrying amount, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of 29.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, which is a full impairment of all existing goodwill.
1403853_20_P13_S2	Of the 29.5 million recorded for goodwill impairment during 2019, 21.9 million related to the Northeast division, 4.9 million related to the Rocky Mountain division, and 2.7 million related to the Southern division.
1403853_20_P14_S0	During 2019, enterprise valuations in the energy sector materially decreased resulting in a lower estimated valuation of the Company and the impairment charge.
1403853_20_P14_S1	See Note 8 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further details on the goodwill impairment during 2019.
1403853_20_P14_S2	Other, net On March 1, 2018, the Board of Directors (the Board determined it was in the best interest of the Company to cease our operations in the Eagle Ford shale area.
1403853_20_P14_S3	In making this determination, the Board considered a number of factors, including among other things, the historical and projected financial performance of our operations in the Eagle Ford shale area, pricing for our services, capital requirements and projected returns on additional capital investment, competition, scope and scale of our business operations, and recommendations from management.
1403853_20_P14_S4	We substantially exited the Eagle Ford shale area as of June 30, 2018.
1403853_20_P14_S5	The total costs related to the exit recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 were 1.1 million .
1403853_20_P15_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded final adjustments to the accrued lease liabilities for the both the Eagle Ford exit and the Mississippian exit in 2015 as further payments were not required.
1403853_20_P15_S1	Interest Expense, net Interest expense, net during the year ended December 31, 2019 was 5.2 million compared to 6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 .
1403853_20_P15_S2	The lower interest expense is primarily due to repayment of the Successor Bridge Term Loan (as defined below) in January of 2019 and continued principal payments on the Successor First and Second Lien Term Loans (as defined below), offset by additional finance leases recorded upon the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ASC 842 as of January 1, 2019 and as a result of our heavy duty truck replacement project.
1403853_20_P15_S3	Other Income, net Other income, net was 0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 .
1403853_20_P15_S4	The decrease is primarily attributable to a 34.0 thousand gain associated with the change in the fair value of the derivative warrant liability during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to a 0.4 million gain during the year ended December 31, 2018.
1403853_20_P15_S5	We issued warrants with derivative features upon our emergence from chapter 11 during 2017.
1403853_20_P15_S6	These instruments are accounted for as derivative liabilities with any decrease or increase in the estimated fair value recorded in Other income, net.

1403853_20_P15_S13	The effective tax rate in 2019 is primarily the result of the change in the deferred tax liability attributable to long-lived assets.
1403853_20_P15_S14	See Note 18 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information on income taxes.
1403853_20_P16_S0	Revenues for the Rocky Mountain division decreased during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 due primarily to a 14.3 million decrease in overall water transfer revenues largely stemming from lower trucking volumes outsourced to third parties and an 8.0 million reduction in water transfer revenues from lay flat temporary hose projects.
1403853_20_P16_S1	The decrease in trucking volumes outsourced to third parties was due to less fresh water and flowback hauling from well completion projects in the geographical areas that we serve.
1403853_20_P16_S2	In addition, some of this third party work was replaced by operators using lay flat hose.
1403853_20_P16_S3	The decrease in water transfer service revenues from lay flat temporary hose during 2019 was due to increased overall competition for this service and more specifically from competitors that had better access to water sources.
1403853_20_P16_S4	Disposal volumes in our salt water disposal wells increased by an average of 8,379 barrels per day (or 21.7 and revenue increased proportionally.
1403853_20_P16_S5	Disposal volumes at our landfill decreased by 12,260 tons (or 6.1 due to fewer rigs operating near our landfill, coupled with pricing pressures from competing landfills rendering our facility less attractive to customers relative to the competition.
1403853_20_P16_S6	Rental revenues increased by 2.1 in the current year period due to pricing increases implemented during the current year.
1403853_20_P17_S0	For the Rocky Mountain division, direct operating costs decreased during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 due primarily to decreased water transfer activity.
1403853_20_P17_S1	Direct operating costs improved as a percentage of revenue to 78.7 in the current year as compared to 79.7 in the prior year period.
1403853_20_P17_S2	The Rocky Mountain division had a 5.0 million operating loss during the current year period, as opposed to a 2.8 million loss in the prior year period, due primarily to the aforementioned factors as well as a 4.9 million goodwill impairment charge.
1403853_20_P18_S0	Revenues for the Northeast division increased slightly during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 .
1403853_20_P18_S1	During 2019, natural gas prices, as measured by the Henry Hub Natural Gas index decreased 36 from 3.25 in 2018 to 2.09 in 2019, contributing to a 30 rig count reduction as of December 2019 in the Northeast operating area from 74 in 2018 to 52 in 2019.
1403853_20_P18_S2	Also, as a result of pricing declines, customers sought to reduce costs and turned to the reuse of production water in completion activities leading to a reduction in both price and activity for our water transfer services.
1403853_20_P18_S3	During 2019, we experienced a shift of approximately 50 of our transportation revenue from disposal wells to reuse.
1403853_20_P18_S4	Water reuse inherently reduces trucking activity due to shorter hauling distances as water is being transported between well sites rather than to disposal wells and partially negates our considerable competitive advantage of having higher barrel capacity trailers hauling to better positioned disposal wells.
1403853_20_P18_S5	As a result, overall billable trucking hours declined 9 and revenue decreased from 33.9 million to 29.6 million on a year-over-year basis.
1403853_20_P18_S6	However, the Clearwater Acquisition presented a transportation cost savings due to its proximity to customers and generated saltwater disposal revenues sufficient to offset the declines in trucking.
1403853_20_P19_S0	For the Northeast division, direct operating costs decreased during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to proportionally higher disposal volumes which generate lower costs on a dollar of revenue as compared to our trucking operations.
1403853_20_P20_S0	current year as compared to 86.4 in the prior year period due to the increase in higher margin disposal services.
1403853_20_P20_S1	Operating loss was 18.9 million higher in the current year due mainly to total impairment charges of 22.5 million for goodwill and long-lived assets held for sale, partially offset by 1.4 million in lower depreciation and amortization expense.
1403853_20_P21_S0	Revenues for the Southern division decreased during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 due to three primary factors: a 2.1 million decrease in revenue due to management s decision to exit the Eagle Ford shale area in 2018, a 1.9 million decrease in pipeline revenue and a 1.1 million decline in trucking revenue.
1403853_20_P21_S1	In the Southern division, despite the overall decline in revenue due to pricing pressures, the volume of water transported by our pipeline increased in 2019 driven by a number of new customers acquired to replace the loss of a sizable customer s pipeline volumes.
1403853_20_P21_S2	The volumes from this particular customer largely ceased in May 2019.
1403853_20_P21_S3	Disposal revenue was effectively flat with pricing decreases negating the slight increase in volumes.
1403853_20_P21_S4	Trucking total billed hours were down approximately 24 in 2019 and revenue decreased 1.1 million due to overall lower customer activity in the region.
1403853_20_P21_S5	During 2019, natural gas prices, as measured by the Henry Hub Natural Gas index, decreased 36 from 3.25 in 2018 to 2.09 in 2019, leading to a rig count reduction of 15 in the Southern operating area from 62 in 2018 to 53 in 2019.
1403853_20_P22_S0	In the Southern division, direct operating costs decreased during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 with direct operating costs as a percentage of revenue improving to 66.0 in the current year as compared to 74.1 in the prior year period due to an increase in higher margin disposal services relative to trucking services.
1403853_20_P22_S1	Operating loss improved by 6.2 million over the prior year period due to 5.5 million in restructuring and impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2018 in connection with the Eagle Ford exit, while goodwill impairment charges were 2.7 million during the current year.
1403853_20_P22_S2	Additionally, there was 3.0 million in lower depreciation and amortization expense in the current year period.
1403853_20_P23_S0	The costs associated with the Corporate/Other division are primarily general and administrative costs.
1403853_20_P23_S1	The Corporate general and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 were 16.8 million lower than those reported for the year ended December 31, 2018 due primarily to 15.3 million in compensation costs related to the departure of our former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer during 2018.
1403853_20_P23_S2	Operating loss for the Corporate division improved by 17.2 million due to the aforementioned compensation cost reduction and 0.3 million in non-recurring impairment charges in the prior year period.
1403853_20_P24_S0	Service Revenue Service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 181.8 million, up 22.8 million, or 14.4 , from 159.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1403853_20_P24_S1	Service revenue growth was driven primarily by increased customer demand for our disposal services in all divisions as average operating drilling rigs increased 16 over the prior year in the basins we serve.
1403853_20_P24_S2	Additionally, we saw improvements in activity levels for water transfer services in the Rocky Mountain and Northeast divisions, offset by a decrease in activity levels for water transfer services, including our permanent disposal water pipeline, in the Southern division.
1403853_20_P24_S3	Pricing increases in all divisions also contributed to the increase in service revenue during 2018.
1403853_20_P24_S4	Due to management s decision to exit the Eagle Ford shale area as of March 1, 2018, only 1.8 million in revenues associated with the Eagle Ford shale area were included in service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, while 8.8 million was included in service revenue during the prior year.
1403853_20_P24_S5	Rental Revenue Rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 15.7 million, down 1.4 million, or 8.4 , from 17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1403853_20_P24_S6	However, the prior year included 1.7 million of rental revenues from the Eagle Ford shale area, while the year ended December 31, 2018 only included 0.3 million of rental revenues due to management s decision to exit the Eagle Ford shale area as of March 1, 2018.
1403853_20_P24_S7	Direct Operating Expenses Direct operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were 158.9 million, compared to 148.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 7.3 .
1403853_20_P24_S8	The increase in direct operating expenses was primarily a result of higher revenues resulting from increased demand for our services.
1403853_20_P24_S9	Direct operating expenses improved to 80.5 of revenues from 84.1 in 2017 as a result of fixed cost leverage and pricing increases, which was partially offset by the increased usage of higher cost third party drivers to satisfy increased customer demand, particularly in the Rocky Mountain division.
1403853_20_P25_S0	General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were 38.5 million, up 5.3 million from 33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1403853_20_P25_S1	The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to higher compensation costs, including 15.3 million related to the 2018 departure of our former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, offset by decreases in legal and professional fees.
1403853_20_P25_S2	Additionally, general and administrative expenses in 2018 included 1.3 million in transaction fees for the acquisition of Clearwater.
1403853_20_P25_S3	General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 included 8.8 million in legal and professional fees for our chapter 11 filing that were incurred prior to the May 1, 2017 filing date.
1403853_20_P25_S4	The legal and professional fees for our chapter 11 filing incurred after the May 1, 2017 filing date have been included in Reorganization items, net for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1403853_20_P25_S5	Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 46.4 million, down 21.1 million from 67.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1403853_20_P25_S6	The decrease was primarily the result of higher depreciation recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of a higher depreciable asset base with shorter useful lives due to the new fair values applied by fresh start accounting upon emergence from chapter 11.
1403853_20_P25_S7	This primarily impacted depreciation expense for the first six months after the application of fresh start accounting as of July 31, 2017.
1403853_20_P26_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2018, management approved plans to sell certain assets located in the Southern division as a result of exiting the Eagle Ford shale area.
1403853_20_P26_S1	In addition, management approved the sale of certain assets, primarily frac tanks, located in the Northeast division, that were also expected to sell within one year.
1403853_20_P26_S2	These assets qualified to be classified as assets held for sale and as the fair value of the assets was lower than the net book value, we recorded an impairment charge of 4.8 million, of which 4.4 million related to the Southern division for the Eagle Ford exit, 0.3 million related to the Corporate division for the sale of certain real property in Texas approved to be sold as part of the Eagle Ford exit, and 0.1 million related to the Northeast division.
1403853_20_P26_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2017, management approved plans to sell certain assets located in both the Rocky Mountain and Southern divisions, including trucks and tanks.
1403853_20_P26_S4	These assets qualified to be classified as assets held for sale and as a result the assets were recorded at the lower of net book value or fair value less costs to sell.
1403853_20_P26_S5	This resulted in a long-lived asset impairment charge of 4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1403853_20_P26_S6	See also Note 8 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further discussion.
1403853_20_P26_S7	Other, net On March 1, 2018, the Board determined it was in the best interest of the Company to cease our operations in the Eagle Ford shale area.
1403853_20_P26_S8	In making this determination, the Board considered a number of factors, including among other things, the historical and projected financial performance of our operations in the Eagle Ford shale area, pricing for our services, capital requirements and projected returns on additional capital investment, competition, scope and scale of our business operations, and recommendations from management.
1403853_20_P26_S9	We substantially exited the Eagle Ford shale area as of June 30, 2018.

1403853_20_P47_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
1403853_20_P47_S2	Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates.
1403853_20_P47_S3	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and changes in these judgments and estimates may impact future results of operations and financial condition.
1403853_20_P47_S4	For additional discussion of our accounting policies see Note 3 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

1403853_20_P47_S7	In addition, we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified.
1403853_20_P47_S8	Inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates including, among others, the customer s willingness or ability to pay, our compliance with customer invoicing requirements, the effect of general economic conditions and the ongoing relationship with the customer.

1403853_20_P48_S1	If after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the impairment test is unnecessary.
1403853_20_P48_S2	In the event a determination is made that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the goodwill impairment test must be performed.
1403853_20_P48_S3	The first step of the test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1403853_20_P48_S4	If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to be impaired.
1403853_20_P48_S5	If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, since we have adopted ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, an impairment charge is recorded based on the excess of a reporting unit s carrying amount over its fair value.
1403853_20_P49_S0	When we reviewed goodwill for impairment as of October 1, 2019, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units were less than their carrying value.
1403853_20_P49_S1	As a result, we completed the goodwill impairment test and determined that the fair value of all three reporting units was less than the carrying amount, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of 29.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.
1403853_20_P49_S2	See Note 8 for further details on the goodwill impairment during 2019.
1403853_20_P49_S3	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets with Finite Useful Lives We review long-lived assets including intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a long-lived asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable.
1403853_20_P49_S4	If an impairment indicator is present, we evaluate recoverability by comparing the estimated future cash flows of the asset group, on an undiscounted basis, to their carrying values.
1403853_20_P49_S5	The asset group represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities.
1403853_20_P49_S6	If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is present.
1403853_20_P50_S0	measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long-lived asset (or asset group).
1403853_20_P50_S1	Our determination that an event or change in circumstance has occurred potentially indicating the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable generally includes but is not limited to one or more of the following: (1) a deterioration in an asset s financial performance compared to historical results, (2) a shortfall in an asset s financial performance compared to forecasted results, (3) changes affecting the utility and estimated future demands for the asset, (4) a significant decrease in the market price of an asset, (5) a current expectation that a long-lived asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life, (6) a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset (asset group) is being used or in its physical condition, and (7) declining operations and severe changes in projected cash flows.
1403853_20_P50_S2	We recorded total impairment charges of 0.8 million for long-lived assets classified as held for sale during the year ended December 31, 2019 , which was included in Impairment of long-lived assets in the consolidated statement of operations.
1403853_20_P50_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded total impairment charges of 4.8 million and 4.9 million , respectively, for long-lived assets classified as held for sale.
1403853_20_P50_S4	We could recognize future impairments to the extent adverse events or changes in circumstances result in conditions in which long-lived assets are not recoverable.
1403853_20_P50_S5	See Note 8 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our impairment charges.
1403853_20_P50_S6	Income Taxes and Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets We are subject to federal income taxes and state income taxes in those jurisdictions in which we operate.
1403853_20_P50_S7	We exercise judgment with regard to income taxes in interpreting whether expenses are deductible in accordance with federal income tax and state income tax codes, estimating annual effective federal and state income tax rates and assessing whether deferred tax assets are, more likely than not, expected to be realized.
1403853_20_P50_S8	The accuracy of these judgments impacts the amount of income tax expense we recognize each period.
1403853_20_P50_S9	With regard to the valuation of deferred tax assets, we record valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount considered more likely than not to be realized.
1403853_20_P50_S10	All available evidence is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is needed.
1403853_20_P50_S11	See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further information regarding the valuation of our deferred tax assets and the impact of new legislation.
1403853_20_P50_S12	Future realization of the tax benefit of an existing deductible temporary difference or carryforward ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the tax law.
1403853_20_P50_S13	We have had significant pretax losses in recent years.
1403853_20_P50_S14	Accordingly, we do not have income in carryback years.
1403853_20_P50_S15	These cumulative losses also present significant negative evidence about the likelihood of income in carryforward periods.
1403853_20_P50_S16	Future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences are another source of taxable income that is used in this analysis.
1403853_20_P50_S17	As a result, deferred tax liabilities in excess of deferred tax assets generally will provide support for recognition of deferred tax assets.
1403853_20_P50_S18	However, most of our deferred tax assets are associated with net operating loss NOL carryforwards, many of which statutorily expire after a specified number of years; therefore, we compare the estimated timing of these taxable timing difference reversals with the scheduled expiration of our NOL carryforwards, considering any limitations on use of NOL carryforwards, and record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for which realization is not more likely than not.
1403853_20_P50_S19	In addition, as a result of limitations on the use of our NOLs due to prior ownership changes, we have reduced our deferred tax asset and corresponding valuation allowance by the NOLs that will likely expire unused.
1403853_20_P50_S20	As a matter of law, we are subject to examination by federal and state taxing authorities.
1403853_20_P50_S21	We have estimated and provided for income taxes in accordance with settlements reached with the Internal Revenue Service in prior audits.
1403853_20_P50_S22	Although we believe that the amounts reflected in our tax returns substantially comply with the applicable federal and state tax regulations, both the IRS and the various state taxing authorities can take positions contrary to our position based on their interpretation of the law.
1403853_20_P50_S23	A tax position that is challenged by a taxing authority could result in an adjustment to our income tax liabilities and related tax provision.
1403853_20_P50_S24	We measure and record tax contingency accruals in accordance with GAAP which prescribes a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a return.
1403853_20_P50_S25	Only positions meeting the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized.
1403853_20_P50_S26	A tax position is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1403853_20_P51_S0	On January 1, 2018, we adopted the guidance in ASC 606, including all related amendments, and applied the new revenue standard to all contracts using the modified retrospective method.
1403853_20_P52_S0	there was no adjustment required to the opening balance of retained earnings.
1403853_20_P52_S1	The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under ASC 605, or the accounting guidance in effect for those periods.
1403853_20_P53_S0	Revenues are generated upon the performance of contracted services under formal and informal contracts with customers.
1403853_20_P53_S1	Revenues are recognized when the contracted services for our customers are completed in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.
1403853_20_P53_S2	Sales and usage-based taxes are excluded from revenues.
1403853_20_P53_S3	Payment is due when the contracted services are completed in accordance with the payment terms established with each customer prior to providing any services.
1403853_20_P53_S4	As such, there is no significant financing component for any of our revenues.
1403853_20_P54_S0	Some of our contracts with customers involve multiple performance obligations as we are providing more than one service under the same contract, such as water transfer services and disposal services.
1403853_20_P54_S1	However, our core service offerings are capable of being distinct and also are distinct within the context of contracts with our customers.
1403853_20_P54_S2	As such, these services represent separate performance obligations when included in a single contract.
1403853_20_P54_S3	We have standalone pricing for all of our services which is negotiated with each of our customers in advance of providing the service.
1403853_20_P54_S4	The contract consideration is allocated to the individual performance obligations based upon the standalone selling price of each service, and no discount is offered for a bundled services offering.
1403853_20_P55_S0	We have established liabilities for environmental and legal contingencies.
1403853_20_P55_S1	We record a loss contingency for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
1403853_20_P55_S2	In determining the liability, we consider a number of factors including, but not limited to, the jurisdiction of the claim, related claims, insurance coverage when insurance covers the type of claim and our historic outcomes in similar matters, if applicable.
1403853_20_P55_S3	We are primarily self-insured against physical damage to our property, equipment and vehicles due to large deductibles or self-insurance.
1403853_20_P55_S4	We are also self-insured for certain potential liabilities for third-party vehicular claims.
1403853_20_P55_S5	A significant amount of judgment and the use of estimates are required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters, and the actual outcome could differ significantly from estimated amounts.
1403853_20_P55_S6	The determination of liabilities for these contingencies is reviewed periodically to ensure that we have accrued the proper level of expense.
1403853_20_P55_S7	The liability balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues, including the effect of any applicable insurance coverage for these matters.
1403853_20_P55_S8	While we believe that the amount accrued is adequate, future changes in circumstances, or in our assumptions or estimates, could impact these determinations or have a negative impact on our reported financial results.
1403853_20_P55_S9	We record obligations to retire tangible, long-lived assets on our balance sheet as liabilities, which are recorded at a discount when we incur the liability.
1403853_20_P55_S10	A certain amount of judgment is involved in estimating the future cash flows of such obligations, as well as the timing of these cash flows.
1403853_20_P55_S11	If our assumptions and estimates on the amount or timing of the future cash flows change, it could potentially have a negative impact on our earnings.
1403853_20_P56_S0	See the Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements section of Note 3 on Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for a complete description of recent accounting standards which may be applicable to our operations.
1403853_20_P56_S1	The significant accounting standards that have been adopted during the year ended December 31, 2019 are described in Note 2 on Basis of Presentation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein.
